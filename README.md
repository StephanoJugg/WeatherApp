# WeatherApp
WeatherApp created with React and Typescript

Weatherz is an app I created in order to test my understanding of different React and Typecript concepts.
The app is created based on a Figma design made by a UI/UX designer.
As of today, the app is not completly finished and polished, but the current state is a usable one.
All the data is taken from a free weather API and it is not entirely accurate.

Features: 
HomePage:  current weather data for any location. The location can be changed by typing in the input field
Hourly Page: User can see weather info for every hour of the current day
Daily Page: User can see forecast info for a certain number of days (we have only 3 available from the API)
Weekly Page: Coming Soon (no info from free API)
Montly Page: Coming Soon (no info from free API)
Login Page: Coming Soon - very soon
Signup Page: Coming Soon - very soon
